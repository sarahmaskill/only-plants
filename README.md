What Was the goal of Only Plants?

Our goal with our application was to create a community centered around helping one another become better plant parents by sharing ideas via posts.
A secondary goal was to allow the end user to add plants to their own garden to help manage and organize all of their plants in one space where they can give them fun unique names and indicate how frequently each individual plant needs to be watered!

What we learned while making this page! 
Using Data-id attributes can be very valuable in specific instances ours being with our root/upvote system.
